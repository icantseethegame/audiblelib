These are the things I want to tell you....</i> </p> <p>Robert McCammon delivers \"a tour de force of storytelling\" (<i>BookPage</i>) in his award-winning masterpiece, a novel of Southern boyhood, growing up in the 1960s, that reaches far beyond that evocative landscape to touch listeners universally. <i>Boy's Life</i> is a richly imagined, spellbinding portrait of the magical worldview of the young - and of innocence lost. Zephyr, Alabama, is an idyllic hometown for 11-year-old Cory Mackenson - a place where monsters swim the river deep and friends are forever. Then, one cold spring morning, Cory and his father witness a car plunge into a lake - and a desperate rescue attempt brings his father face-to-face with a terrible, haunting vision of death. As Cory struggles to understand his father's pain, his eyes are slowly opened to the forces of good and evil that surround him. From an ancient mystic who can hear the dead and bewitch the living, to a violent clan of moonshiners, Cory must confront the secrets that hide in the shadows of his hometown - for his father's sanity and his own life hang in the balance....</p>","title":"Boy's Life","titleShort":"Boy's Life"},{"added":265,"asin":"B019NMZ6FE","authors":[{"name":"Pierce Brown","url":"B00EDBZVNI"}],"blurb":"Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war.

When her master dies at sea on the voyage from Poland, she is unmoored and adrift as the ship arrives in New York Harbor. Ahmad is a jinni, a being of fire, born in the ancient Syrian Desert. Trapped in an old copper flask by a Bedouin wizard centuries ago, he is released accidentally by a tinsmith in a Lower Manhattan shop. </p> <p>Struggling to make their way in this strange new place, the Golem and the Jinni try to fit in with their neighbors while masking their true natures. Surrounding them is a community of immigrants: the coffeehouse owner Maryam Faddoul, a pillar of wisdom and support for her Syrian neighbors; the solitary ice cream maker Saleh, a damaged man cursed by tragedy; the kind and caring Rabbi Meyer and his beleaguered nephew, Michael, whose Sheltering House receives newly arrived Jewish men; the adventurous young socialite Sophia Winston; and the enigmatic Joseph Schall, a dangerous man driven by ferocious ambition and esoteric wisdom. </p> <p>Meeting by chance, the two creatures become unlikely friends whose tenuous attachment challenges their opposing natures, until the night a terrifying incident drives them back into their separate worlds. But a powerful menace will soon bring the Golem and the Jinni together again, threatening their existence and forcing them to make a fateful choice. </p> <p>Marvelous and compulsively listenable, The Golem and the Jinni weaves strands of folk mythology, historical fiction, and magical fable into a wondrously inventive and unforgettable tale.</p>","title":"The Golem and the Jinni: A Novel","titleShort":"The Golem and the Jinni"},{"added":256,"asin":"1478916591","authors":[{"name":"Joe Abercrombie","url":"B001JP7WJC"}],"blurb":"On the blood-soaked borders of Angland, Leo dan Brock struggles to win fame on the battlefield, and defeat the marauding armies of Stour Nightfall.

For a thousand years the Skaa slaved in misery and lived in fear. For a thousand years the Lord Ruler, the \"Sliver of Infinity,\" reigned with absolute power and ultimate terror, divinely invincible. Then, when hope was so long lost that not even its memory remained, a terribly scarred, heart-broken half-Skaa rediscovered it in the depths of the Lord Ruler's most hellish prison.&nbsp;</p> <p>Kelsier \"snapped\" and found in himself the powers of a Mistborn. A brilliant thief and natural leader, he turned his talents to the ultimate caper, with the Lord Ruler himself as the mark. Kelsier recruited the underworld's elite, the smartest and most trustworthy allomancers, each of whom shares one of his many powers, and all of whom relish a high-stakes challenge. Only then does he reveal his ultimate dream, not just the greatest heist in history, but the downfall of the divine despot. But even with the best criminal crew ever assembled, Kel's plan looks more like the ultimate long shot, until luck brings a ragged girl named Vin into his life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Like him, she's a half-Skaa orphan, but she's lived a much harsher life. Vin has learned to expect betrayal from everyone she meets, and gotten it. She will have to learn to trust, if Kel is to help her master powers of which she never dreamed.&nbsp;</p> <p>This saga dares to ask a simple question: What if the hero of prophecy fails?</p> <p>Other Tor books by Brandon Sanderson</p> <ul> <li><i>The Cosmere</i></li> <li><i>The Stormlight Archive</i></li> <li><i>The Way of Kings</i></li> <li><i>Words of Radiance</i></li> <li><i>Edgedancer </i>(Novella)</li> <li><i>Oathbringer&nbsp;</i></li> </ul> <p>The Mistborn trilogy:</p> <ul> <li><i>Mistborn: The Final Empire</i></li> <li><i>The Well of Ascension</i></li> <li><i>The Hero of Ages</i></li> </ul> <p>Mistborn: The Wax and Wayne series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alloy of Law</i></li> <li><i>Shadows of Self</i></li> <li><i>Bands of Mourning</i></li> <li><i>Collection</i></li> <li><i>Arcanum Unbounded</i></li> </ul> <p>Other Cosmere novels</p> <ul> <li><i>Elantris</i></li> <li><i>Warbreaker</i></li> </ul> <p>The Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians series:</p> <ul> <li><i>Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians</i></li> <li><i>The Scrivener's Bones</i></li> <li><i>The Knights of Crystallia</i></li> <li><i>The Shattered Lens</i></li> <li><i>The Dark Talent</i></li> </ul> <p>The Rithmatist series:</p> <ul> <li><i>The Rithmatist</i></li> </ul> <p>Other books by Brandon Sanderson</p> <ul> <li><i>The Reckoners</i></li> <li><i>Steelheart</i></li> <li><i>Firefight</i></li> <li><i>Calamity&nbsp;</i></li> </ul>","title":"The Final Empire: Mistborn Book 1","titleShort":"The Final Empire"},{"added":251,"asin":"1774240823","authors":[{"name":"Brian K.

Where most of his colleagues looked at a battlefield map of World War II's African theater and saw a protracted struggle with Rommel's desert forces, Stirling saw an opportunity: Given a small number of elite, well-trained men, he could parachute behind enemy lines and sabotage their airplanes and war matériel. </p> <p>Paired with his constitutional opposite, the disciplined martinet Jock Lewes, Stirling assembled a revolutionary fighting force that would upend not just the balance of the war but the nature of combat itself. He faced no little resistance from those who found his tactics ungentlemanly or beyond the pale, but in the SAS' remarkable exploits facing the Nazis in Africa and then on the continent can be found the seeds of nearly all special forces units that would follow. </p> <p>Bringing his keen eye for psychological detail to a riveting wartime narrative, Ben Macintyre uses his unprecedented access to SAS archives to shine a light inside a legendary unit long shrouded in secrecy. The result is not just a tremendous war story but a fascinating group portrait of men of whom history and country asked the most. </p>","title":"Rogue Heroes: The History of the SAS, Britain's Secret Special Forces Unit That Sabotaged the Nazis and Changed the Nature of War","titleShort":"Rogue Heroes"},{"added":248,"asin":"B00P0277C2","authors":[{"name":"Cixin Liu","url":"B007JP96JU"}],"blurb":"Set against the backdrop of China’s Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Genre Fiction","url":"18574456011"}],"cover":"51pHYR3yHaL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"13h 26m","narrators":[{"name":"Luke Daniels"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B010PKSKBA","authors":"Cixin Liu, Joel Martinsen - translator","cover":"51KRXJa3SmL","length":"22 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"P.

Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.</p> <p>Built on the groundwork of the Iliad, Madeline Miller’s page-turning, profoundly moving, and blisteringly paced retelling of the epic Trojan War marks the launch of a dazzling career.</p>","title":"The Song of Achilles: A Novel","titleShort":"The Song of Achilles"},{"added":238,"asin":"B088C4DBYP","authors":[{"name":"Dennis E.

A grand strategy game was devised by Captain Gilbert Roberts and a group of 10 Wrens (members of the Women's Royal Naval Service) assigned to his team in an attempt to reveal the tactics behind the vicious success of the German U-boats. Played on a linoleum floor divided into painted squares, it required model ships to be moved across a make-believe ocean in a manner reminiscent of the childhood game Battleship.

The island is a magical place where stories and legends grow as thick as the Spanish moss dangling in the trees. Now, Nana Mora's eyesight is fading, and there's something she wants to show Eliza before it’s totally gone: a mythical place locals refer to as Sirens Harbor. Supposedly hidden somewhere on the island, it's a place where all the mermaids in the world congregate once a year to sing their Winter Song. It's all fairy-tale silliness, according to Eliza's mom.

Challenges abound for the adventurers: old maps are hard to read, and treacherous trails spiral through the woods. And there's a strange storm spinning all around them.

Determined to set Pallavi on the right path, Usha arranges date after date with potential suitors - but after yet another setup fails, it seems her efforts are proving fruitless. But in an unexpected turn of events, Pallavi becomes her own matchmaker when she meets - and quickly falls for - Sandeep, a young Indian-American entrepreneur.

Lured to the great Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 by the hope of becoming a samurai - without really knowing what it meant - he regains consciousness after the battle to find himself lying defeated, dazed, and wounded among thousands of the dead and dying.

Continually striving to perfect his technique, which leads him to a unique style of fighting with two swords simultaneously, he travels far and wide, challenging fighters of many disciplines, taking nature to be his ultimate and severest teacher and undergoing the rigorous training of those who follow the way. He is supremely successful in his encounters, but in <i>The Art of War</i>, he perceives the way of peaceful and prosperous governance and disciplines himself to be a real human being.</p> <p>He becomes a reluctant hero to a host of people whose lives he has touched and by whom he has been touched.

After the Boston Tea Party, British and American soldiers and Massachusetts residents have warily maneuvered around each other until April 19, when violence finally erupts at Lexington and Concord. In June, however, with the city cut off from supplies by a British blockade and Patriot militia poised in siege, skirmishes give way to outright war in the Battle of Bunker Hill. It would be the bloodiest battle of the Revolution to come, and the point of no return for the rebellious colonists. </p> <p>Philbrick brings a fresh perspective to every aspect of the story. He finds new characters, and new facets to familiar ones. The real work of choreographing rebellion falls to a thirty-three year old physician named Joseph Warren who emerges as the on-the-ground leader of the Patriot cause and is fated to die at Bunker Hill. Others in the cast include Paul Revere, Warren's fiancee, the poet Mercy Scollay, a newly recruited George Washington, the reluctant British combatant General Thomas Gage and his more bellicose successor William Howe, who leads the three charges at Bunker Hill and presides over the claustrophobic cauldron of a city under siege as both sides play a nervy game of brinkmanship for control. </p> <p>With passion and insight, Philbrick reconstructs the revolutionary landscape - geographic and ideological - in a mesmerizing narrative of the robust, messy, blisteringly real origins of America.</p>","title":"Bunker Hill: A City, a Siege, a Revolution","titleShort":"Bunker Hill"},{"added":193,"asin":"B002V5A1EW","authors":[{"name":"Bernard Cornwell","url":"B000APAB68"}],"blurb":"1799.

Rowling and has raised money for her children’s charity Lumos ever since.</p> <p>As familiar to Hogwarts students as \"Cinderella\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" are to Muggle children, Beedle’s stories are a collection of popular fairy tales written for young witches and wizards. So, if you’re wondering what’s in store in this brand-new audio edition...well, your ears are in for a treat.</p> <p>Once you’ve checked this fabulous Hogwarts Library book out, you’ll start by hearing the author’s introduction, read by Sally Mortemore (librarian Madam Pince from the Harry Potter films). Then it’s time for the tales to begin....</p> <p>You’ll laugh along to \"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\" as you listen to the havoc wreaked by a father’s impish gift to his son, read by Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\" will take you on a quest through an enchanted garden, alongside three witches and a luckless knight, read by Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>In \"The Warlock’s Hairy Heart\", you’ll be warned about a young warlock who is fearful of love and turns to dark magic to avoid it at all costs, read by Jason Isaacs (Lucius Malfoy - Harry Potter films).</p> <p>The calamitous meeting of a foolish king, a cunning charlatan and a mischievous washerwoman unravels in \"Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\", read by Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley - Harry Potter).</p> <p>And finally, the most iconic of Beedle’s stories. \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\" - with its message of humility and wisdom - will introduce you, dear listener, to the Deathly Hallows, read by Noma Dumezweni (Hermione Granger - <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>, London’s West End and New York’s Broadway).</p> <p>Each of the tales is accompanied by wise and whimsical notes from a certain Albus Dumbledore, surely everyone’s favourite headmaster, read by Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore - Fantastic Beasts films).</p> <p>We’re told these five fables have been firm favourites in wizarding households for centuries, and now it’s your turn to experience these tales from the Wizarding World, as you’ve never heard them before.</p> <p><i>At least 90 percent of the proceeds* received by Pottermore Limited from this audiobook will be made available by the publisher to The Lumos Foundation for their work to help children worldwide out of institutions, so they can thrive in loving families and communities. The Lumos Foundation is a charity registered in England and Wales with registered charity number 1112575.</i></p> <p>Around the world, more than eight million children live in orphanages and other institutions. What may be surprising is that about 80 percent of them aren’t actually orphans. They have family who could care for them, with the right support. Lumos is an international children’s charity founded by J.K. Rowling. Named after the light-giving spell in Harry Potter, Lumos’ mission is to ensure that by 2050 all children will grow up in loving, protective families.</p> <p>*Proceeds means the cash-price or cash-equivalent price less sales taxes and reasonable expenses.&nbsp;</p>","title":"The Tales of Beedle the Bard","titleShort":"The Tales of Beedle the Bard"},{"added":188,"asin":"B074WH171J","authors":[{"name":"Peter Clines","url":"B0039LGSLW"}],"blurb":"Nothing ever changes in Sanders.

The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people. The first is Khader Khan: mafia godfather, criminal-philosopher-saint, and mentor to Lin in the underworld of the Golden City. The second is Karla: elusive, dangerous, and beautiful, whose passions are driven by secrets that torment her and yet give her a terrible power. </p> <p>Burning slums and five-star hotels, romantic love and prison agonies, criminal wars and Bollywood films, spiritual gurus and mujaheddin guerrillas - this huge novel has the world of human experience in its reach, and a passionate love for India at its heart. Based on the life of the author, it is by any measure the debut of an extraordinary voice in literature.</p>","title":"Shantaram: A Novel","titleShort":"Shantaram"},{"added":185,"asin":"0061999881","authors":[{"name":"C.

It's perfectly safe</b>. </p> <p>The folks in Mike Erikson's small New England town would say he's just your average, everyday guy. And that's exactly how Mike likes it. Sure, the life he's chosen isn't much of a challenge to someone with his unique gifts, but he's content with his quiet and peaceful existence. That is until an old friend presents him with an irresistible mystery, one that Mike is uniquely qualified to solve. </p> <p>Far out in the California desert, a team of DARPA scientists has invented a device they affectionately call the Albuquerque Door. Using a cryptic computer equation and magnetic fields to \"fold\" dimensions, it shrinks distances so a traveler can travel hundreds of feet with a single step. The invention promises to make mankind's dreams of teleportation a reality. And, the scientists insist, traveling through the door is completely safe. Yet evidence is mounting that this miraculous machine isn't quite what it seems - and that its creators are harboring a dangerous secret. </p> <p>As his investigations draw him deeper into the puzzle, Mike begins to fear there's only one answer that makes sense. And if he's right, it may be only a matter of time before the project destroys...everything. A cunningly inventive mystery featuring a hero worthy of Sherlock Holmes and a terrifying final twist you'll never see coming, <i>The Fold</i> is that rarest of things: a genuine pause-resister science-fiction thriller.

By 1939, a massive rally of some 20,000 homegrown Nazi supporters was held in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. While across the Hudson River in Newark, New Jersey, the town’s large German population stepped up Nazi recruitment activity. Pro-fascist groups staged parades, screened anti-Semitic films, and organized boycotts of Jewish businesses and politicians throughout the city. Complicating matters, Newark was also the epicenter of the Jewish mob.</p> <p>Abner 'Longie' Zwillman, known as the \"Al Capone of New Jersey\", had made a fortune in gambling, bootlegging, racketeering, and controlled the city’s ports and police force. Not surprisingly, this powerful Jewish gangster took exception to the Nazi’s anti-Semitic platform. In response, Zwillman helped organize a group of ex-boxers, factory workers, and students to defend the city’s Jewish interests. The group dubbed themselves the Minutemen - ready at a moment’s notice - and took to breaking up Nazi gatherings using an intimidating combination of stink bombs, baseball bats, brass knuckles, and pure chutzpah.</p> <p>Greg Donahue’s <i>The Minuteman</i> tells the story of one of Newark’s native sons - ex-prizefighter and longtime Zwillman enforcer Sidney Abramowitz, aka Nat Arno - who took over leadership of the Minutemen in 1934 and made it his personal business to put an end to what he saw as the homegrown Nazi movement’s \"anti-American\" activities. For six years, Arno and his crew of vigilantes battled Newark’s Nazis at every turn. <i>The Minuteman</i> is a story of the ethics of violence in the face of fascism - a forgotten legacy that is as relevant now as it was nearly a hundred years ago.</p> <p><b>Photos Included in Cover Art Courtesy of the Jewish Historical Society of New Jersey -

The son of a zookeeper, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of animal behavior and a fervent love of stories and practices not only his native Hinduism but also Christianity and Islam. When Pi is 16, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450 pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them \"the truth\".

When she has a hunch about an ongoing murder investigation, she knows it could be her only chance to prove herself and truly break into the “boys' club” of Dublin’s police force.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;Carrie uncovers this make-or-break moment in a case file that her sister Aifric, a newly qualified barrister, leaves on their kitchen counter: Robert Collins has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend after a fight in a local pub. All signs point toward a guilty verdict, but both sisters quickly begin to find evidence that complicates the story. All the while, Carrie is very aware that she’s crossed the line—if the detective sergeant running the investigation finds out she’s been messing around with his case, her career will be over before it has begun. Aoife McMahon lends her authentic accent and her knowledge of the series’ characters, delivering a powerful performance that heightens the drama with every twist and turn.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note: This audio contains strong language, distressing situations, and descriptions of violence that some listeners may find upsetting.

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>","title":"Artemis","titleShort":"Artemis"},{"added":140,"asin":"B071Y9TTHC","authors":[{"name":"Adrian Tchaikovsky","url":"B002XLHS8Q"}],"blurb":"Adrian Tchaikovksy's critically acclaimed stand-alone novel Children of Time is the epic story of humanity's battle for survival on a terraformed planet....","categories":[{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18580606011"},{"name":"Science Fiction","url":"18580628011"}],"cover":"51tuexbxdIL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"16h 31m","narrators":[{"name":"Mel Hudson"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"1549119788","authors":"Adrian Tchaikovsky","cover":"61SGZQll9GL","length":"15 hrs and 26 mins","narrators":"Mel Hudson","title":"Children of Ruin"},{"asin":"B07BHVWFSM","authors":"Dennis E.

This compilation provides a platform and much needed space for the many generations of women who have been tucked away into the corners of our history, erased, and ignored and shines a light on vibrant voices of today celebrating our power to heal, transform, and rise again. From interviewing public figures as problematic as Fidel Castro, to experiencing a leaky brain and the miraculous feats of modern medicine or losing a loved one to the brutalities of Alzheimer's, these storytellers share it all. Modeling vulnerability for the listener, we are given access to somber reflections on the current administration's impact on the marginalized - from those in violent cycles of poverty to those experiencing the gentrification crisis firsthand, to a passionate call to remember the children still in cages. This collection wouldn't be complete without vital stories of incredibly heartwarming coming-out experiences and journeys abroad that uplift us and remind us of our ability to overcome anything that comes our way.&nbsp;</p> <p>Original stories by: Liza Ann Acosta, Maria Alexandria Beech, Sarah Bogdanski, Gabriela Bonet, Franceli Chapman, Antonieta Carpio, Marissa Chibas, Gina Cornejo, Ginna Diaz, Mari DeOleo, Melissa DuPrey, Georgina Escobar, Cristina Frias, Virginia Grise, Christina Igaraividez, Isabel Jimenez, Maya Malan-Gonzalez, Alexandra Meda, Jasminne Mendez, Elisa Noemi, Elizabeth Nungaray, Karari Olvera, Jessica Perez, Lorna Silva, Gabriela Ortega.&nbsp;</p> <p>Created by Teatro Luna &amp; Teatro Luna West - an ensemble creating original theatrical productions, digital media, and direct-action events toward a social justice purpose.&nbsp;</p> <p>Directed by Alexandra Meda&nbsp;</p> <p>Co-produced by Christina Igaraividez and Alexandra Meda&nbsp;</p> <p>Original music by Maria Chavez &amp; Mark VanHare&nbsp;</p> <p>Sound design by Fan Zhang&nbsp;</p>","title":"Talking While Female & Other Dangerous Acts","titleShort":"Talking While Female & Other Dangerous Acts"},{"added":131,"asin":"B07V6HFYZT","authors":[{"name":"Steve Burns","url":"B07VHJP8T4"},{"name":"Steven Drozd","url":"B07VGNYBY4"},{"name":"Gabe Soria","url":"B00NATNBTA"}],"blurb":"Foreverywhere tells the tale of a young unicorn (perhaps the last on Earth?!) and his quest, along with a Giant named Rick, a spider named Betsy and the guitar-shredding Princess Rainbow, to form the best band in the fantastical world of Anyville....","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Animals & Nature","url":"18572099011"}],"cover":"61bX80tWX3L","downloaded":true,"format":"Original Recording Audiobook","language":"English","length":"3h","narrators":[{"name":"Steve Burns"},{"name":"Carly Ciarrocchi"},{"name":"Stephanie Mayers"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07QL3CQ39","authors":"Jacob Stein, Jason Rabinowitz, The Pop Ups","cover":"51Pjl7vMzAL","length":"3 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Jason Rabinowitz, Jacob Stein, Cara Samantha, and others","title":"Jukebox Joyride"},{"asin":"B07SVL2CFM","authors":"Catherine Hapka","cover":"51Hf-kXsDKL","length":"2 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Kyla Garcia","title":"Clue by Clue: Carmen Sandiego"},{"asin":"1984884735","authors":"Ibi Zoboi","cover":"51Ml5HxdTJL","length":"7 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Ibi Zoboi","title":"My Life as an Ice Cream Sandwich"},{"asin":"B07X7J8YJ3","authors":"Dan Wells","cover":"51uh6OvizhL","length":"3 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Emily Woo Zeller, Steve Rimpici, full cast","title":"Dragon Planet"},{"asin":"B079TZXVZV","authors":"Joel ben Izzy, Diane Ferlatte, Bill Gordh, and others","cover":"5184+Ql-PiL","length":"8 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Samantha Land","title":"Story Party: The Complete Collection"},{"asin":"B07MHWXL3C","authors":"Rebecca Tinker","cover":"515gGdWTWwL","length":"4 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Kyla Garcia","title":"Who in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?"},{"asin":"B0067QRF8Q","authors":"Beverly Cleary, Tracy Dockray","cover":"611-I+l8GFL","length":"18 hrs and 56 mins","narrators":"Stockard Channing","title":"The Ramona Quimby Audio Collection"},{"asin":"B083Q6J15H","authors":"Sarah Doll","cover":"51jIs+ANyZL","length":"3 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Joana Garcia","subHeading":"Short Funny, Fantasy Stories for Children and Toddlers to Help Them Fall Asleep and Relax.

It is this, the inner life of the astronauts, that Tom Wolfe describes with his almost uncanny empathetic powers that made <i>The Right Stuff</i> a classic. </p> <p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR: </p> <p>Tom Wolfe is the author of more than a dozen books, among them such contemporary classics as <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i> and <i>A Man in Full</i>.

Now he turns his attention back to the source, presenting a bravura rendition of the great northern tales. In <i>Norse Mythology</i>, Gaiman fashions primeval stories into a novelistic arc that begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds; delves into the exploits of the deities, dwarves, and giants; and culminates in Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods and the rebirth of a new time and people. Gaiman stays true to the myths while vividly reincarnating Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly strong yet not the wisest of gods; and Loki, the son of a giant, a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. From Gaiman's deft and witty prose emerge the gods with their fiercely competitive natures, their susceptibility to being duped and to duping others, and their tendency to let passion ignite their actions, making these long-ago myths breathe pungent life again.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>","title":"Norse Mythology","titleShort":"Norse Mythology"},{"added":111,"asin":"B00N22TBNU","authors":[{"name":"Ian Fleming","url":"B00O53RH3G"}],"blurb":"For James Bond the stakes couldn't be higher. 007's mission is to neutralize the Russian operative Le Chiffre by ruining him at the baccarat table, forcing his Soviet masters to \"retire\" him....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Action & Adventure","url":"18574427011"}],"cover":"51-vQecQLcL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"5h 2m ","myRating":"4","narrators":[{"name":"Dan Stevens"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B00N24I6U2","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"410SShoirSL","length":"6 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Rory Kinnear","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 2","title":"Live and Let Die"},{"asin":"B00N24HAMC","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51hl8y15J9L","length":"7 hrs and 28 mins","narrators":"Bill Nighy","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 3","title":"Moonraker"},{"asin":"B00N22MTE8","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51h8AP09x3L","length":"6 hrs and 46 mins","narrators":"Damian Lewis","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 4","title":"Diamonds Are Forever"},{"asin":"B00N24ER3W","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51pCFcQNYNL","length":"8 hrs and 57 mins","narrators":"Toby Stephens","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 5","title":"From Russia with Love"},{"asin":"B00N25KVMC","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"415PXTuwe3L","length":"8 hrs","narrators":"Hugh Quarshie","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 6","title":"Dr. No"},{"asin":"B00N24EZ7A","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"41sSbHDkQZL","length":"8 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Hugh Bonneville","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 7","title":"Goldfinger"},{"asin":"B00N24FAYC","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"41CriCLHGGL","length":"7 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Jason Isaacs","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 9","title":"Thunderball"},{"asin":"B00N42HKA4","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"619W10Xy3ZL","length":"8 hrs and 6 mins","narrators":"David Tennant","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 11","title":"On Her Majesty's Secret Service"},{"asin":"B00N24E30E","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"6177sabmocL","length":"6 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Samuel West","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 8","title":"For Your Eyes Only, and Other Stories"},{"asin":"B00N24EAPC","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"41l2Jlmr0IL","length":"4 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Rosamund Pike","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 10","title":"The Spy Who Loved Me"},{"asin":"B00N24D7QA","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51Ff42Wig9L","length":"7 hrs and 33 mins","narrators":"Martin Jarvis","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 12","title":"You Only Live Twice"},{"asin":"B00N25KKJ6","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51kvC+8UqmL","length":"4 hrs and 56 mins","narrators":"Kenneth Branagh","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 13","title":"The Man with the Golden Gun"},{"asin":"B00N22NGQI","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51G28XorVkL","length":"3 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Tom Hiddleston, Lucy Fleming","subHeading":"James Bond, Book 14","title":"Octopussy and The Living Daylights, and Other Stories"},{"asin":"B00TKNRT0M","authors":"Ian Fleming","cover":"51XRdw5WtXL","length":"5 hrs and 25 mins","narrators":"Oliver Siebeck","subHeading":"James Bond 1","title":"Casino Royale"},{"asin":"B00ZJQ8188","authors":"Michael Crichton","cover":"51KN4KaMjJL","length":"11 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"MacLeod Andrews","subHeading":"A Novel","title":"Rising Sun"},{"asin":"B002V5BE1Q","authors":"Isaac Asimov","cover":"419uCX4uDNL","length":"8 hrs and 20 mins","narrators":"Scott Brick","title":"I, Robot"},{"asin":"B07DWBLKH3","authors":"Anthony Horowitz","cover":"51hZGUIbcOL","length":"7 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Matthew Goode","subHeading":"A James Bond Novel","title":"Forever and a Day"},{"asin":"B002V5H0LE","authors":"Philip K.

In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater.

His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.&nbsp;</p> <p>In her long-awaited book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in <i>Seabiscuit</i>.

Malkiel's classic and gimmick-free investment guide is now more necessary than ever. Rather than tricks, what you'll find here is a time-tested and thoroughly research-based strategy for your portfolio. Whether you're considering your first 401(k) contribution or contemplating retirement, this fully updated edition of <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i> should be the first book on your wish list. </p> <p>In <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>, you'll learn the basic terminology of \"The Street\" and how to navigate it with the help of a user-friendly, long-range investment strategy that really works. Drawing on his own varied experience as an economist, financial adviser, and successful investor, Malkiel shows why, despite recent advice to the contrary from so-called experts in the wake of the financial crisis, an individual who buys over time and holds a low-cost, internationally diversified index of securities is still likely to exceed the performance of portfolios carefully picked by professionals using sophisticated analytical techniques. </p> <p>In this new edition, Malkiel has provided valuable new material throughout the book on exchange-traded funds and investment opportunities in emerging markets, and in a brand-new, timely chapter, Malkiel authoritatively assesses the pitfalls and prospects of the latest investing trend, \"smart beta\". On top of all this, the book's classic life-cycle guide to investing, which tailors strategies to investors of any age, will help you plan confidently for the future. You'll learn how to analyze the potential returns not only for basic stocks and bonds but for the full range of investment opportunities - from money-market accounts and real estate investment trusts to insurance, home ownership, and tangible assets like gold and collectibles. </p>","title":"A Random Walk Down Wall Street: A Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing (Eleventh Edition)","titleShort":"A Random Walk Down Wall Street"},{"added":106,"asin":"B00MEL8VSG","authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Backman","url":"B00KV5TN4I"}],"blurb":"Meet Ove.

But after spreading out through space for almost a century, Bob and his clones just can't stay out of trouble.&nbsp;</p> <p>They've created enough colonies so humanity shouldn't go extinct. But political squabbles have a bad habit of dying hard, and the Brazilian probes are still trying to take out the competition. And the Bobs have picked a fight with an older, more powerful species with a large appetite and a short temper.&nbsp;</p> <p>Still stinging from getting their collective butts kicked in their first encounter with the Others, the Bobs now face the prospect of a decisive final battle to defend Earth and its colonies. But the Bobs are less disciplined than a herd of cats, and some of the younger copies are more concerned with their own local problems than defeating the Others.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet salvation may come from an unlikely source. A couple of eighth-generation Bobs have found something out in deep space. All it will take to save the Earth and perhaps all of humanity is for them to get it to Sol - unless the Others arrive first.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>All These Worlds</i> is the third installment in the blockbuster Audible Original Bobiverse series - which has sold more than one million copies.</p>","title":"All These Worlds: Bobiverse, Book 3","titleShort":"All These Worlds"},{"added":97,"asin":"B00WNBF0RM","authors":[{"name":"Neal Stephenson","url":"B000APS8L8"}],"blurb":"A catastrophic event renders the earth a ticking time bomb.

What if you could change it back? </p> <p>In this brilliantly conceived tour de force, Stephen King - who has absorbed the social, political, and popular culture of his generation more imaginatively and thoroughly than any other writer - takes listeners on an incredible journey into the past and the possibility of altering it. </p> <p>It begins with Jake Epping, a 35-year-old English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching GED classes. He asks his students to write about an event that changed their lives, and one essay blows him away: a gruesome, harrowing story about the night more than 50 years ago when Harry Dunning’s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a sledgehammer. Reading the essay is a watershed moment for Jake, his life - like Harry’s, like America’s in 1963 - turning on a dime. </p> <p>Not much later his friend Al, who owns the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to the past, a particular day in 1958. And Al enlists Jake to take over the mission that has become his obsession - to prevent the Kennedy assassination. </p> <p>So begins Jake’s new life as George Amberson, in a different world - of Ike and JFK and Elvis, of big American cars and sock hops and cigarette smoke everywhere. From the dank little city of Derry, Maine (where there’s Dunning business to conduct), to the warmhearted small town of Jodie, Texas, where Jake falls dangerously in love, every turn is leading, eventually of course, to a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and to Dallas, where the past becomes heart-stoppingly suspenseful - and where history might not be history anymore. Time-travel has never been so believable.

Irreverent, unpredictable, and leery of the sports establishment, Knight created the most muscular jock culture in business, a place where employees routinely took two hours at lunch to work out and then strategized late into the night in their holy war against competitors Reebok and Adidas. To outsiders, Nike was a cult. Insiders believed they were furthering the company's mission: to improve the performance of serious athletes. </p> <p>Not everyone could be a Nike guy. It required a certain attitude. For example: Michael Jordan refusing to wear Reebok at the 1992 Olympics, or Charles Barkley joking about becoming a porn star. In <i>Just Do It</i>, award-winning author Donald Katz shows how Nike created the spectacular imagery and marketing campaigns that made Jordan, Barkley, and Bo Jackson international icons. He also documented Nike's increasingly influential role in the management of its high-priced talent, taking us inside lucrative endorsement deals involving Jim Courier, Andre Agassi, Deion Sanders, Alonzo Mourning, and Pete Sampras as well as behind-closed-doors negotiations with the NBA and the NCAA as it considered a controversial plan for a collegiate Super Bowl brokered by Nike and super-agent Michael Ovitz. </p> <p>Nike understood the power of imagery and knew how to market those images all over the world. A truly global corporation, Nike relied on capital from Japan to manufacture shoes in Asia sold to one out of every four athletic-shoe buyers in Europe. Katz follows Nike all over the world, taking us from a 19-year-old Korean gluing shoes in a factory, to an advertising wunderkind in Oregon creating the legendary \"Bo Knows\" campaign, to the fanatical Nike kids who rush into stores the day new shoes hit the street. Along the way, Katz describes the creation and design of Nike shoes, revealing technology worthy of a James Bond movie. He examines the charges leveled against Nike: that the company is exploiting Asian peasants, corrupting younger athletes, and recklessly stirring consumer fever in urban America. He also discusses the corporate spirit and strategies that have made Nike one of the great business stories of the late 20th century. </p> <p><i>Just Do It</i> is about the business of sports and the sport of business. It is also the story of a culture in which the sight of an athlete in flight can still evoke awe. </p>","title":"Just Do It: The Nike Spirit in the Corporate World","titleShort":"Just Do It"},{"added":87,"asin":"B07D3ZQQCS","authors":[{"name":"Jeff Wheeler","url":"B004SBCEK6"}],"blurb":"Theirs is a world of opposites.

Then came young adulthood, and with it a wave of doubt so strong it caused him to question everything he thought he knew about himself and the world. Ever skeptical and full of questions, Arkin embarked on a spiritual journey to find something—anything—to believe in. An existential crisis in his 30s led him to the study of Eastern philosophy. Soon he began opening himself to the possibility that there was more to life than what he had simply seen, heard, or been taught.</p> <p>In this Audible Original \"mini-memoir,\" the 84-year-old actor shares his powerful spiritual experiences, from his brush with reincarnation to the benefits of meditation. In a gruff, earthy voice that sounds more suited to a New York cabbie than a spiritual guide, he shows us that wisdom can come from the most unexpected places and teachers. <i>Out of My Mind</i> is a candid, relatable, and delightfully irreverent take on how one man went searching for meaning and ended up discovering himself.&nbsp;</p>","title":"Out of My Mind","titleShort":"Out of My Mind"},{"added":85,"asin":"B07K4VYQ5X","authors":[{"name":"Dan Wells","url":"B002S2VIBS"}],"blurb":"It’s one kid versus an entire band of space pirates in this cosmic middle grade caper from New York Times bestselling author Dan Wells....","categories":[{"name":"Children's Audiobooks","url":"18572091011"},{"name":"Science Fiction & Fantasy","url":"18572586011"}],"cover":"51gRWzJyGzL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"4h 8m","narrators":[{"name":"Emily Woo Zeller"},{"name":"Margaret Ying Drake"},{"name":"Josh Hurley"},{"name":"Eddy Lee"},{"name":"Jennifer Van Dyck"},{"name":"Allyson Johnson"},{"name":"David Shih"},{"name":"Betsy Hogg"},{"name":"Chelsea Spack"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07X7J8YJ3","authors":"Dan Wells","cover":"51uh6OvizhL","length":"3 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Emily Woo Zeller, Steve Rimpici, full cast","title":"Dragon Planet"},{"asin":"B08VYFG11M","authors":"Dan Wells","cover":"510rFrx0KGL","length":"4 hrs and 29 mins","narrators":"Cindy Kay, Margaret Ying Drake, Betsy Hogg, and others","title":"Stargazer"},{"asin":"B07MHWXL3C","authors":"Rebecca Tinker","cover":"515gGdWTWwL","length":"4 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Kyla Garcia","title":"Who in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?"},{"asin":"1980053413","authors":"Lee Bacon","cover":"51r6pIyXxOL","length":"6 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Michael Crouch","title":"The Last Human"},{"asin":"B07SVL2CFM","authors":"Catherine Hapka","cover":"51Hf-kXsDKL","length":"2 hrs and 48 mins","narrators":"Kyla Garcia","title":"Clue by Clue: Carmen Sandiego"},{"asin":"B07QL3CQ39","authors":"Jacob Stein, Jason Rabinowitz, The Pop Ups","cover":"51Pjl7vMzAL","length":"3 hrs and 31 mins","narrators":"Jason Rabinowitz, Jacob Stein, Cara Samantha, and others","title":"Jukebox Joyride"},{"asin":"152485123X","authors":"Dustin Brady","cover":"61lIgRGRMXL","length":"13 hrs and 27 mins","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","title":"Trapped in a Video Game: The Complete Series"},{"asin":"B074ZMDT31","authors":"Neil Patrick Harris","cover":"51gBqOx6jLL","length":"4 hrs and 13 mins","narrators":"Neil Patrick Harris","title":"The Magic Misfits"},{"asin":"B07DFSW9C7","authors":"Lee Bacon","cover":"51B74AxMbhL","length":"6 hrs and 24 mins","narrators":"Bryan Kennedy, Jessica Almasy, Josh Hurley, and others","title":"The Mystery of Alice"},{"asin":"B01MXLSLR3","authors":"James Riley","cover":"51e6WqQXp3L","length":"8 hrs and 54 mins","narrators":"Kirby Heyborne","subHeading":"Story Thieves, Book 1","title":"Story Thieves"},{"asin":"B00CH35Q5C","authors":"Lee Bacon","cover":"515Ucsu-C+L","length":"5 hrs and 45 mins","narrators":"Maxwell Glick","title":"Joshua Dread"},{"asin":"1549114972","authors":"Neil Patrick Harris","cover":"51CO8mIH4xL","length":"5 hrs and 34 mins","narrators":"Christina Hendricks, Neil Patrick Harris","title":"The Magic Misfits: The Second Story"},{"asin":"B07YZKZ887","authors":"Patrick Carman","cover":"51wTCWI54dL","length":"2 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Dr. Mike Kennedy, Hunter Peterson, Marlin Ramsey Chan, and others","title":"The Claw"},{"asin":"B074XG31BD","authors":"Max Brallier","cover":"51Zz59ODuvL","length":"2 hrs and 52 mins","narrators":"Robbie Daymond","title":"The Last Kids on Earth"},{"asin":"B00PHH1CY4","authors":"Winter Morgan","cover":"51tKBA2WnyL","length":"2 hrs and 23 mins","narrators":"Luke Daniels","subHeading":"A Minecraft Gamer's Adventure","title":"Quest for the Diamond Sword"},{"asin":"1549123440","authors":"Neil Patrick Harris","cover":"61Ce5IK9LtL","length":"5 hrs and 18 mins","narrators":"Tre Hall, Neil Patrick Harris","title":"The Magic Misfits: The Minor Third"},{"asin":"B06ZY1NX5Q","authors":"Max Brooks","cover":"51KzUWvMPSL","length":"6 hrs and 17 mins","narrators":"Jack Black","subHeading":"An Official Minecraft Novel","title":"Minecraft: The Island (Narrated by Jack Black)"},{"asin":"B00H4E03M0","authors":"Chris Grabenstein","cover":"616yOlhGFaL","length":"6 hrs and 19 mins","narrators":"Jesse Bernstein","title":"Escape from Mr. Lemoncello's Library"}],"progress":0,"publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"rating":4.5,"ratings":14792,"releaseDate":"2018-12-06","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/orig/000434/or_orig_000434_sample.mp3","series":[{"asin":"B07W71ZFR1","bookNumbers":["1"],"name":"The Zero Chronicles"}],"summary":"<p>It’s one kid versus an entire band of space pirates in this cosmic middle grade caper from New York Times bestselling author Dan Wells.</p> <p>Zero is just one of 20,000 people aboard a spaceship bound for a new planet set to be colonized.

Frequently joined by a number of historians, authors, and reenactors, Fry seems to be having a wonderful time recounting some of the fascinating arcana of the ostensibly tightly wound Victorian Era. With whimsical music to mark the short, informative, and entertaining chapters, Fry delivers hidden truths and juicy secrets on subjects ranging from scandals and sanitation to sexuality and sadism. Diaries, journals, newspaper articles, and historical materials of the period offer listeners you-are-there reenactments of crime, sex, freaks, medical practices, and more - all interspersed with Fry's amusing commentary. Thanks to Fry, audio is unquestionably the best way to enjoy this material.

He also digs deep into the lives of two scientists who revolutionized climate predictions, bringing warning systems to previously unimaginable levels of accuracy. One is Kathy Sullivan, a gifted scientist among the first women in space; the other, D.J. Patil, is a trickster-turned-mathematician and a political adviser.

Her mother wound up with a debilitating brain injury after surviving a car accident. Tiffany never fit in anywhere: not in the households she rotated through in the foster care system and certainly not at the nearly all white high school she had to ride the bus an hour to attend. As an illiterate ninth grader, Tiffany did everything she could to survive. After a multitude of jobs, she finally realized that she had talent in an area she never would have suspected: comedy. Tiffany faced the 'routine' hindrances of climbing the entertainment business ladder - but had the added obstacles of sex, race, and class in her way. But she got there. She's humble, grateful, down to earth, and funny as hell. She still cleans the toilet the way she was shown by a foster mom who worked as a maid, and she still rolls her joints the way one of her foster dads taught her.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tiffany can't avoid being funny: It's just who she is. But <i>The Last Black Unicorn</i> is so much more than a side-splittingly hilarious collection of essays - it's a memoir of the struggles of one woman who came from nothing and nowhere.

A world in which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides - or are chosen.

Caro: a short, penetrating reflection on the evolution and workings of political power - for good and for ill.</b> </p> <p> In <i>On Power</i>, an Audible exclusive, the legendary historian Robert A. Caro reflects on what drew him as a young journalist to study political power and what his half century of reporting on New York City urban planner Robert Moses and President Lyndon Johnson has taught him about the inner workings of government and democracy. </p> <p>Adapted by the author from two recent speeches and filled with thoughtful lessons and personal moments, <i>On Power</i> goes behind the scenes in the author's decades-long quest to understand how power works, often in ways he could have never imagined. </p> <p>Listening to <i>On Power</i>, narrated with emotion and humor by Caro in his unmistakable New York accent, is like having a private audience with the author often hailed as our greatest living historian. Longtime fans of Caro's books, as well as those seeking a more personal introduction to his life and work, will be treated to his trademark wit and revelatory insight. </p> <p>But more than anything, <i>On Power</i> is a timely reminder for those who want to better understand how power and government work. </p> <p>In Caro's words: \"Why political power? Because it shapes all of our lives. It shapes your life in ways that you might never think about. Every time a young man goes to college on a federal education bill passed by Lyndon Johnson, that's political power. And so is a young man dying in Vietnam. Every time an elderly person is able to afford an MRI, that's Medicare. That's political power. It affects your life in all sorts of ways. My books are an attempt to explain this power.... Because the more America understands about political power, the better informed our votes will be, and then, hopefully, the better our democracy should be.\" </p>","title":"On Power","titleShort":"On Power"},{"added":30,"asin":"B073JS84YF","authors":[{"name":"Jon Ronson","url":"B001H6KH4U"}],"blurb":"From bestselling writer Jon Ronson and the executive producer behind the TED Radio Hour and Invisibilia, Audible Originals presents a new seven-episode series....","categories":null,"cover":"6112mCWmTiL","downloaded":true,"format":"Radio/TV Program","language":"English","length":"3h 25m","narrators":[{"name":"Jon Ronson"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B07JK61MK3","authors":"Jon Ronson","cover":"51XW8b1aDrL","length":"3 hrs and 43 mins","narrators":"Jon Ronson","title":"The Last Days of August"},{"asin":"B009L8EMRE","authors":"Jon Ronson","cover":"51hwP9X0oSL","length":"15 hrs and 22 mins","narrators":"Jon Ronson","title":"Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries"},{"asin":"B00507AXAA","authors":"Jon Ronson","cover":"61OW2syCGiL","length":"7 hrs and 33 mins","narrators":"Jon Ronson","subHeading":"A Journey Through the Madness Industry","title":"The Psychopath Test"},{"asin":"B01M7O0HG9","authors":"Jon Ronson","cover":"51Hw034TB9L","length":"1 hr and 47 mins","narrators":"Jon Ronson","subHeading":"A Journey into the Trump Campaign and the \"Alt-Right\"","title":"The Elephant in the Room"},{"asin":"B009AFT0E8","authors":"Jon Ronson","cover":"51WqfIBhaTL","length":"8 hrs and 16 mins","narrators":"Jon Ronson","title":"Them: Adventures with Extremists"},{"asin":"B01FYDBL0A","authors":"Jon Ronson","cover":"51HNdSj1sUL","length":"6 hrs and 36 mins","narrators":"Jon Ronson","title":"The Men Who Stare at Goats"}],"progress":0,"publishers":[{"name":"Audible Originals"}],"rating":4.1,"ratings":13799,"releaseDate":"2017-07-27","sample":"https://samples.audible.com/or/a071/000005/or_a071_000005_sample.mp3","series":null,"summary":"<p>From best-selling writer Jon Ronson and the executive producer behind the <b><i>TED Radio Hour</i></b> and <i><b>Invisibilia</b></i>, Audible Originals presents a new seven-episode series, <i>The Butterfly Effect with Jon Ronson</i>. </p> <p> [Contains explicit content] Hear the story of what happened when the tech industry gave the world what it wanted: free porn.

It's sort of about porn, but it's about a lot of other things. It's sad, funny, moving and totally unlike some other nonfiction stories about porn - because it isn't judgmental or salacious. It's human and sweet and strange and lovely. It's a mystery story, an adventure. It's also, I think, a new way of telling a story. This season follows a single butterfly effect. The flap of the butterfly’s wings is a boy in Brussels having an idea. His idea is how to get rich from giving the world free online porn. Over seven episodes I trace the consequences of this idea, from consequence through to consequence. If you keep going in this way, where might you end up? It turns out you end up in the most surprising and unexpected places. </i></p> <p><i>So if you're thinking, why do I want to listen to a show about the tech takeover of the porn industry, I have two things to say: </i></p> <p><i>1. Why wouldn't you want to listen to a show about the tech takeover of the porn industry? That's a great idea for a show. </i></p> <p><i>2. Would you want to listen to a show about three women destroying a mysterious Norwegian man's stamp collection? Well, that happens at the end of episode 2. At the end of Episode 3 a woman becomes convinced that she played a part in a murder committed by an Italian priest. At the end of Episode 4 a boy in Oklahoma is forced to move to a house on the very, very edge of his town. </i></p> <p><i>I hope you like our show, </i></p> <p><i>Jon Ronson</i> </p>","title":"The Butterfly Effect with Jon Ronson","titleShort":"The Butterfly Effect with Jon Ronson"},{"added":29,"asin":"B01MF4WPSC","authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Grahame","url":"/search"}],"blurb":"The story of Mole, Ratty, Badger, and Toad and their escapades, whether messing about on the river or poop-pooping in Toad's shiny new car, cannot fail to enchant....","cover":"716FsdtNwQL","downloaded":true,"length":"6h 57m","narrators":[{"name":"Michael Hordern"}],"progress":0,"storePageMissing":true,"title":"The Wind in the Willows [Soundtrack Edition]"},{"added":28,"asin":"B002V5D5ZE","authors":[{"name":"Douglas Adams","url":"B000AQ2A84"}],"blurb":"Facing annihilation at the hands of the warlike Vogons?

Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he's assigned, he'll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: A man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. </p> <p>Since its publication in 1961, no novel has matched <i>Catch-22</i>'s intensity and brilliance in depicting the brutal insanity of war. This 50th-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller's masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; personal essays on the genesis of the novel by the author; a wealth of critical responses and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers from Joseph Heller's personal archive; and a selection of advertisements from the original publishing campaign that helped turn <i>Catch-22</i> into a cultural phenomenon. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature. </p>","title":"Catch-22","titleShort":"Catch-22"},{"added":25,"asin":"B003QKSO4K","authors":[{"name":"James Patterson","url":"B000APZGGS"},{"name":"Maxine Paetro","url":"/search"}],"blurb":"The police can't help you.

Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English literary and social critic, historian, playwright, poet, Catholic theologian, debater, mystery writer, and foremost, a novelist. Among the primary achievements of Chesterton's extensive writing career are the wide range of subjects written about, the large number of genres employed, and the sheer volume of publications produced. He wrote several plays, around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories and 4,000 essays. Chesterton's writings without fail displayed wit and a sense of humor by incorporating paradox, yet still making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, theology, philosophy and many other topics. His talent as a mystery writer is displayed in his collection of detective stories, <i>The Man Who Knew Too Much</i>. In each story, the star detective, Horne Fisher, deals with another strange mystery: the vanishing of a priceless coin, the framing of an Irish \"prince\" freedom fighter, an eccentric rich man dies during an obsessive fishing trip, another vanishing during an ice skate, a statue crushing his own uncle, and a few more. </p><p>Includes \"The Face in the Targe\", \"The Vanishing Prince\", \"The Soul of the Schoolboy\", \"The Bottomless Well\", \"The Fad of the Fisherman\", \"The Hole in the Wall\", \"The Temple of Silence\", and \"The Vengeance of the Statue\".</p>","title":"The Man Who Knew Too Much","titleShort":"The Man Who Knew Too Much"},{"added":19,"asin":"B005ZIMPJG","authors":[{"name":"Charles Dickens","url":"B000APYNYE"}],"blurb":"One of the most revered works in English literature, Great Expectations traces the coming of age of a young orphan, Pip, from a boy of shallow aspirations into a man of maturity....","categories":[{"name":"Literature & Fiction","url":"18574426011"},{"name":"Classics","url":"18574449011"}],"cover":"61f8oxmdSWL","downloaded":true,"format":"Unabridged Audiobook","language":"English","length":"18h 32m","narrators":[{"name":"Simon Prebble"}],"peopleAlsoBought":[{"asin":"B002V08IYW","authors":"Charles Dickens","cover":"51Ecc++n0tL","length":"13 hrs and 39 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"A Tale of Two Cities [Tantor]"},{"asin":"B002V0TGKM","authors":"Charles Dickens","cover":"61BgXkJCauL","length":"16 hrs and 7 mins","narrators":"Simon Vance","title":"Oliver Twist"},{"asin":"B01728H3VQ","authors":"Charles Dickens","cover":"61bm4wET7kL","length":"36 hrs and 30 mins","narrators":"Richard Armitage","title":"David Copperfield"},{"asin":"B00BWYDMK8","authors":"F.

For a while he turned to school-mastering and clerking, but failed to make a sustainable income. In 1840 he signed up on the whaler, Acushnet, out of New Bedford, Massachusetts. He was just 21. A whaler's life turned out to be both arduous and dangerous, and in 1842, Melville deserted ship.
